## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Upgrade the plugin to Sylius `~1.12`, PHP `^8.2`, and Symfony `^6.4` (from Sylius
  `~1.8 || ~1.9`). Migrated the bundled test application to the Sylius 1.12 configuration.

### Added

- Make-based development workflow (`Makefile`) wrapping setup, tests, and static analysis.
- `make serve-test` target serving the test app in the `test` environment on
  `https://127.0.0.1:8081`, so the `@javascript` Behat suite runs against the test database
  instead of the dev server.
- `docker-compose.yml` providing MySQL 8 (host port 3307) and headless Chrome (port 9222) for
  the test suite.
- Architecture Decision Log under `docs/adr-log/`, project guides `AGENTS.md` and `ai/`.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`, adoption of Conventional Commits, and a `.gitmessage` template.
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): static analysis, unit tests, and the
  non-JavaScript Behat suite, driven through the Make targets.
- `make backend-test` target to create the test-environment database/schema.

### Removed

- Psalm and PhpSpec from the toolchain; static analysis is PHPStan `^2.0` (with
  `phpstan-baseline.neon`) and unit tests are PHPUnit.
- `easy-coding-standard.yml`, replaced by `ecs.php` (`sylius-labs/coding-standard ^4.0`).
- Bitbucket Pipelines (`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`), replaced by GitHub Actions.

## [1.0.0] - 2021-11-17

### Added

- Initial release of the RMA plugin for Sylius `~1.8 || ~1.9`.
